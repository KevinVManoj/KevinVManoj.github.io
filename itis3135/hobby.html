        <h2>What is Working Out?</h2>
        <p>Working out, also known as physical exercise, is the practice of engaging in physical activities to improve health, fitness, and overall well-being. This can include a wide range of activities such as weightlifting, running, yoga, and more. The goal is to strengthen the body, increase endurance, enhance flexibility, and promote mental health. Regular workouts are essential for maintaining a balanced lifestyle and can help prevent various health issues while also improving mood and energy levels. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned athlete, incorporating exercise into your daily routine is a key component of a healthy lifestyle.</p>
        <p>I dedicate myself to regular exercise and bodybuilding, with the goal of sculpting a better physique that embodies both aesthetics and strength. My routine is a balanced mix of resistance training, cardio workouts, and a nutritional plan tailored to fuel my body's needs. This disciplined approach allows me to enhance muscle definition, reduce body fat, and improve my overall physical performance. Through this journey, I've not only transformed my body into a stronger, more resilient version of itself but have also gained confidence and a sense of mental well-being. My commitment to fitness is a testament to the power of persistence, discipline, and my personal desire to achieve the best physical version of myself.</p>

        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>My name is Kevin Manoj, I am a Sophmore at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte studying Computer Science with a Concentration of Cyber Security. I am 20 years old, 180 pounds and 5'9. My max squat is 140 pounds, my max bench is 110 pounds, and I have yet to actually do a deadlift. </p>
        <p>I have had a weird history with working out, I started the summer between my senior year and freshman year at college at a Planet Fitness. The, when I arrived here at UNCC, I went here and there but nothing commited. It was only this semester where I realized I needed to take my health seriously and this included eating better and more working out.</p>

        <h2>When do I work out?</h2>
        <p>I work out 3 times a week; usually Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. I tend to work out around 8:30pm to 9:30pm-10pm. I try and do some cardio on the days I dont work out (unless I just hit legday) such as the treadmill, stairmaster, or the bike. </p>
