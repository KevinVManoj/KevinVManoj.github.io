            <h3><a href="https://www.spacejam.com/1996/">Space Jam 1996</a></h3>
            <p>Space Jam's website from 1996 is a nostalgic-looking website, showing the promotional material for the Space Jam Movie. The site has a mix of bright colors, animated GIFs, and an early internet web design.</p>
            <ul class="WE">
                <li>
                    Contrast: The website has bad contract, with bright text on a primarily light and dark background which makes it hard to read
                </li>
                <li>
                    Repitition: Most pages are the same, an image and some red text but sometimes the pages have different backgrounds and different text, some of the pages dont even work
                </li>
                <li>
                    Alignment: The alignment is good, the space between each other looks good
                </li>
                <li>
                    Proximity: The home elements are somewhat close to each other in a nice fashion so its not bad
                </li>
                <p>The Space Jam website does not adhere well to the CRAP principles as well as it could have. Its design is very primitive and low effort, resulting in a visually chaotic and disappointing user experience. Also some of the links dont even work anymore.</p>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3><a href="https://www.wsj.com/">Wall Street Journal</a></h3>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal's website is a professional platform providing news and analysis on global business, finance, and politics. The site features an organized layout, prioritizing readability and user experience.</p>
            <ul class="WE">
                <li>

                </li>
                <li>
                    Repitition: Repetition is pretty good, with consistent use of fonts, colors, and formatting across the site..
                </li>
                <li>
                    Alignment: The website follows a clear alignment strategy, with content organized in a grid layout
                </li>
                <li>
                    Proximity: Proximity is properly utilized with related elements placed close together, emphasizing their connection
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal's website demonstrates a strong adherence to the CRAP principles. Its design has an effective use of contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity, resulting in a visually pleasing and user-friendly experience.</p>
